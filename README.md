A tentative to build a free and open source medical CRM that is expected to be used by medical cabinets of 1-10 people. Cloud and on premises offerings are to be offered. 

This project is built with Java 11 + Spring Boot and ReactJS with TypeScript and BlueprintJS.

We'll move to java 17 if the project will prove to be "_worthy of it_", or it'll be "_too easy to not to_"
